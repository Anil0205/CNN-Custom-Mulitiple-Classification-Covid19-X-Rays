This project aims to classify the input image as either a dog or a cat image. The image input which you give to the system will be analyzed and the predicted result will be given as output. Machine learning algorithm [Convolutional Neural Networks] is used to classify the image

# Covid


COVID-19 when left undetected can lead to a hazardous infection spread, leading to an unfortunate loss of life. It’s of utmost importance to diagnose COVID-19 in Infected patients at the earliest, to avoid further complications. RT-PCR, the gold standard method is routinely used for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Yet, this method comes along with few limitations such as its time-consuming nature, a scarcity of trained manpower, sophisticated laboratory equipment and the possibility of false positive and negative results. Physicians and global health care centers use CT scan as an alternate for the diagnosis of COVID-19. But this process of detection too, might demand more manual work, effort and time. Thus, automating the detection of COVID-19 using an intelligent system has been a recent research topic, in the view of pandemic. This will also help in saving the physician’s time for carrying out further treatment. In this paper, a hybrid learning model has been proposed to identify the COVID-19 infection using CT X ray  images.
